# FCFS-Scheduling-using-Cpp
Given n processes with their burst times, the task is to find average waiting time and average turn around time using FCFS scheduling algorithm.  First in, first out (FIFO), also known as first come, first served (FCFS), is the simplest scheduling algorithm. FIFO simply queues processes in the order that they arrive in the ready queue.  In this, the process that comes first will be executed first and next process starts only after the previous gets fully executed.  Here we are considering that arrival time for all processes is 0.

Characteristics of FCFS method
1. It supports non-preemptive and pre-emptive scheduling algorithm.
2. Jobs are always executed on a first-come, first-serve basis.
3. It is easy to implement and use.
4. This method is poor in performance, and the general wait time is quite high.
